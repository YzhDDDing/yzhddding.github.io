My name is Zehong Yu (喻泽弘). I am a PhD student at the [Software System Security Assurance Group](http://wingtecher.com/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) since September 2024, under the tutelage of Prof. [Yu Jiang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangyu198964/home), currently. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) in 2021 and master degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2024.

My works focus on improving the efficiency of code generation and test case generation for Simulink models. Besides, I'm also interested in the areas of model driven development and embedded software engineering.
